                  Clothing is one of the primary needs of humans just after food
                  and shelter. In modern time, textiles are not restricted to
                  necessity but a statement of fashion. With the requirement of
                  variation in design, a career in Textile Engineering and
                  designing is increasing tremendously. Experts and
                  professionals in the textile industry work with the aim to
                  manufacture the best quality and durable textiles which
                  satisfy human desires and needs.

                  The U.S. textile industry is a nearly $70 billion sector when
                  measured by the value of industry shipments. It remains one of
                  the biggest parts of the manufacturing industry and is one of
                  the largest markets in the world by export value: $23 billion
                  in 2018. A textile is a flexible material made up of a network
                  of natural or artificial fibers such as yarn or thread.

                  The attire you are wearing or using is a part of the textile.
                  Or we can take examples of towels we use every day. That is a
                  part of the textile too. And many more objects around us are
                  part of the textile.Textile engineering is about designing and
                  developing the process to make fabrics.In fact, you cannot
                  think of a day without textiles.
